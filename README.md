# Welcome to my project!

This is a very very very early version, but if you want to see what I've already done, head here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C21ulfixBkzAaghhLIaLteQFtK2rt3pr, download, unzip and run the .exe

Sprites are taken from these awesome packs:
- https://opengameart.org/content/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack by Kyrise
- https://o-lobster.itch.io/simple-dungeon-crawler-16x16-pixel-pack by o-lobster
Remember to check them out!

Apart from the sprites everything is done by me. The code is in **Fast-Loot-RPG/Fast Loot RPG/Assets/Scripts/RPG** directory, feel free to check it out.
